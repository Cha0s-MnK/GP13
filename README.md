# GP13 Transient Project

Welcome to the study of GP13 Transient! These are codes written by 2 Chinese guys in LPNHE, France.

Our latest progress can be view in <https://www.overleaf.com/read/jhpdwhtbgkcg#28dbe4>.

## search.py & plot_rate.py

These 2 files can plot the transient rates by reading data from GP13. You need to change the `search_data_dir` and `search_result_dir` in `config.py`. Note that the data directory should be like `data/YYYYMMDD/`, which means that you should sort data by dates.

## plot_rate.py

Run in your PC.
